# APS360-Labs
Labs done for APS360 in Winter AY 2021-2022 at University of Toronto.

## Objectives
### Lab 1:
1. Perform basic PyTorch tensor operations.
2. Load data into PyTorch
3. Configure an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using PyTorch
4. Train ANNs using PyTorch
5. Evaluate different ANN configuations

### Lab 2:
1. Training loop for a machine learning model.
2. Understand the distinction between training, validation, and test data.
3. Overfitting and underfitting.
4. Hyperparameter testing, such as learning rate and batch size, affect the success of training.
5. Compare an ANN (aka Multi-Layer Perceptron) with a CNN.


### Lab 3:
1. Generate and preprocess custom data
2. Load and split data for training, validation and testing
3. Train a Convolutional Neural Network
4. Apply transfer learning to improve the model

### Lab 4:
1. Clean and process continuous and categorical data for machine learning using Pandas and Numpy.
2. Implement an autoencoder that takes continuous and categorical (one-hot) inputs.
3. Tune the hyperparameters of an autoencoder.
4. Use baseline models to help interpret model performance.


### Lab 5:
1. Clean and process text data for machine learning.
2. Understand and implement a character-level recurrent neural network.
3. Use torchtext to build recurrent neural network models.
4. Understand batching for a recurrent neural network, and use torchtext to implement RNN batching.


My final APS360 project was on Colorizing Black and White Images using Autoencoders with Instance Awareness, found at https://github.com/H12324/APS360-Project
